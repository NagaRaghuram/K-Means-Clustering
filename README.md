K-Means Clustering:

# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
## Overview
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment retail customers based on their purchasing behaviors.
By analyzing customer data, the algorithm identifies distinct groups, enabling businesses to tailor marketing strategies and enhance customer experiences.

## Features
- Load customer data from a CSV file
- Standardize features for effective clustering
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
- Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers
- Visualize clusters and centroids

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

>>Dataset:
  The project uses a CSV file containing customer information, including:
  #CustomerID
  #Annual Income (k$)
  #Spending Score (1-100)
Make sure to update the dataset path in the code to point to your CSV file.

Usage:
(1)Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/NagaRaghuram (Your Username)/customer-segmentation.git
   cd customer-segmentation
(2)Update the dataset path in the code to your CSV file.
(3)Run the script:python kmeans_clustering.py

Code Description:
>The code loads customer data, standardizes the features using StandardScaler, and employs the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.
>After determining the ideal cluster count, it applies the K-Means algorithm to group customers and visualizes the results with a scatter plot.
>This process provides insights into customer segments for improved marketing strategies.

Results:
Upon running the code, a scatter plot will be displayed, showing the different customer clusters and their centroids. The clusters represent distinct customer segments based on purchasingÂ behavior.
