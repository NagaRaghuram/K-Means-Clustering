Project Overview:
This project aims to segment customers of an online retail store based on their purchase history using K-Means clustering. 
By analyzing customer data, we can group customers into distinct segments,allowing for more targeted marketing strategies and improved customer service.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the Online Retail Dataset from Kaggle.
It includes transactional data from a UK-based online retailer and contains fields such as invoice numbers, product codes, quantities, unit prices, and customer IDs.

Project Steps:
>>Data Loading and Preprocessing:
(1)Load the dataset from a ZIP file.
(2)Clean the data by removing missing values and invalid transactions.
(3)Create a TotalPrice column for total spending per transaction.

>>Feature Engineering
  (1)Calculate RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features:
     >Recency: Days since the last purchase.
     >Frequency: Number of unique invoices per customer.
     >Monetary: Total amount spent by each customer.
  (2)Apply log transformation to the Monetary feature.
>>Data Standardization
   >Standardize RFM features to ensure equal contribution to the clustering algorithm.
>>K-Means Clustering
   >Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers based on standardized RFM features.
   >Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods such as the elbow method or silhouette analysis.
>>Cluster Analysis
   >Analyze cluster characteristics by calculating the mean values of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary for each cluster.
   >Interpret results to understand customer segment profiles.
>>Visualization
   >Create visualizations to inspect and understand the clusters, including pair plots and scatter plots.
>>Reporting and Insights
  >Summarize findings and provide recommendations for targeted marketing and customer service improvements.
